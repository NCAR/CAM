Introduction
***************

This report presents the details of the governing equations, physical
parameterizations, and numerical algorithms defining the version of the
NCAR Community Atmosphere Model designated . The material provides an
overview of the major model components, and the way in which they
interact as the numerical integration proceeds. Details on the coding
implementation, along with in-depth information on running the code, are
given in a separate technical report entitled ‘ ‘User’s Guide to
Community Atmosphere Model’’ . As before, it is our objective that this
model provide NCAR and the university research community with a
reliable, well documented atmospheric general circulation model. This
version of the incorporates a number enhancements to the physics package
(adjustments to the deep convection algorithm including the addition of
Convective Momentum Transports (CMT), a transition to the finite volume
dynamical core as default and the option to run a computationally highly
scaleable dynamical core). The ability to transition between
CAM-standalone and fully coupled experiment frameworks is much improved
in . We believe that collectively these improvements provide the
research community with a significantly improved atmospheric modeling
capability.

 Brief History
===============

-----------------
 CCM0 and CCM1
-----------------

Over the last twenty years, the NCAR Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD)
Division has provided a comprehensive, three-dimensional global
atmospheric model to university and NCAR scientists for use in the
analysis and understanding of global climate. Because of its widespread
use, the model was designated a community tool and given the name
Community Climate Model (CCM). The original versions of the NCAR
Community Climate Model, CCM0A and CCM0B , were based on the Australian
spectral model and an adiabatic, inviscid version of the ECMWF spectral
model . The CCM0B implementation was constructed so that its simulated
climate would match the earlier CCM0A model to within natural
variability (incorporated the same set of physical parameterizations and
numerical approximations), but also provided a more flexible
infrastructure for conducting medium– and long–range global forecast
studies. The major strength of this latter effort was that all aspects
of the model were described in a series of technical notes, which
included a Users’ Guide , a subroutine guide which provided a detailed
description of the code a detailed description of the algorithms , and a
compilation of the simulated circulation statistics . This development
activity firmly established NCAR’s commitment to provide a versatile,
modular, and well–documented atmospheric general circulation model that
would be suitable for climate and forecast studies by NCAR and
university scientists. A more detailed discussion of the early history
and philosophy of the Community Climate Model can be found in .

The second generation community model, CCM1, was introduced in July of
1987, and included a number of significant changes to the model
formulation which were manifested in changes to the simulated climate.
Principal changes to the model included major modifications to the
parameterization of radiation, a revised vertical finite-differencing
technique for the dynamical core, modifications to vertical and
horizontal diffusion processes, and modifications to the formulation of
surface energy exchange. A number of new modeling capabilities were also
introduced, including a seasonal mode in which the specified surface
conditions vary with time, and an optional interactive surface hydrology
that followed the formulation presented by . A detailed series of
technical documentation was also made available for this version and
more completely describe this version of the CCM.

------
 CCM2
------

The most ambitious set of model improvements occurred with the
introduction of the third generation of the Community Climate Model,
CCM2, which was released in October of 1992. This version was the
product of a major effort to improve the physical representation of a
wide range of key climate processes, including clouds and radiation,
moist convection, the planetary boundary layer, and transport. The
introduction of this model also marked a new philosophy with respect to
implementation. The CCM2 code was entirely restructured so as to satisfy
three major objectives: much greater ease of use, which included
portability across a wide range of computational platforms; conformance
to a plug-compatible physics interface standard; and the incorporation
of single-job multitasking capabilities.

The standard CCM2 model configuration was significantly different from
its predecessor in almost every way, starting with resolution where the
CCM2 employed a horizontal T42 spectral resolution (approximately 2.8 x
2.8 degree transform grid), with 18 vertical levels and a rigid lid at
2.917 mb. Principal algorithmic approaches shared with CCM1 were the use
of a semi-implicit, leap frog time integration scheme; the use of the
spectral transform method for treating the dry dynamics; and the use of
a bi-harmonic horizontal diffusion operator. Major changes to the
dynamical formalism included the use of a terrain-following hybrid
vertical coordinate, and the incorporation of a shape-preserving
semi-Lagrangian transport scheme for advecting water vapor, as well as
an arbitrary number of other scalar fields (cloud water variables,
chemical constituents, etc.). Principal changes to the physics included
the use of a :math:`\delta`-Eddington approximation to calculate solar
absorption ; the use of a Voigt line shape to more accurately treat
infrared radiative cooling in the stratosphere; the inclusion of a
diurnal cycle to properly account for the interactions between the
radiative effects of the diurnal cycle and the surface fluxes of
sensible and latent heat; the incorporation of a finite heat capacity
soil/sea ice model; a more sophisticated cloud fraction parameterization
and treatment of cloud optical properties ; the incorporation of a
sophisticated non-local treatment of boundary-layer processes ; the use
of a simple mass flux representation of moist convection , and the
optional incorporation of the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme
(BATS) of . As with previous versions of the model, a User’s Guide and
model description were provided to completely document the model
formalism and implementation. Control simulation data sets were
documented in .

------
 CCM3
------

The CCM3 was the fourth generation in the series of NCAR’s Community
Climate Model. Many aspects of the model formulation and implementation
were identical to the CCM2, although there were a number of important
changes that were incorporated into the collection of parameterized
physics, along with some modest changes to the dynamical formalism.
Modifications to the physical representation of specific climate
processes in the CCM3 were motivated by the need to address the more
serious systematic errors apparent in CCM2 simulations, as well as to
make the atmospheric model more suitable for coupling to land, ocean,
and sea-ice component models. Thus, an important aspect of the changes
to the model atmosphere was that they address well known systematic
biases in the top-of-atmosphere and surface (to the extent that they
were known) energy budgets. When compared to the CCM2, changes to the
model formulation fell into five major categories: modifications to the
representation of radiative transfer through both clear and cloudy
atmospheric columns, modifications to hydrological processes (i.e., in
the form of changes to the atmospheric boundary layer, moist convection,
and surface energy exchange), the incorporation of a sophisticated land
surface model, the incorporation of an optional slab mixed-layer
ocean/thermodynamic sea-ice component, and a collection of other changes
to the formalism which did not introduce significant changes to the
model climate.

Changes to the clear-sky radiation formalism included the incorporation
of minor CO\ :math:`_2` bands trace gases (:math:`CH_4`, :math:`N{_2}O`,
:math:`CFC11`, :math:`CFC12`) in the longwave parameterization, and the
incorporation of a background aerosol (0.14 optical depth) in the
shortwave parameterization. All-sky changes included improvements to the
way in which cloud optical properties (effective radius and liquid water
path) were diagnosed, the incorporation of the radiative properties of
ice clouds, and a number of minor modifications to the diagnosis of
convective and layered cloud amount. Collectively these modification
substantially reduced systematic biases in the global annually averaged
clear-sky and all-sky outgoing longwave radiation and absorbed solar
radiation to well within observational uncertainty, while maintaining
very good agreement with global observational estimates of cloud
forcing. Additionally, the large warm bias in simulated July surface
temperature over the Northern Hemisphere, the systematic over-prediction
of precipitation over warm land areas, and a large component of the
stationary-wave error in CCM2, were also reduced as a result of
cloud-radiation improvements.

Modifications to hydrological processes included revisions to the major
contributing parameterizations. The formulation of the atmospheric
boundary layer parameterization was revised (in collaboration with Dr.
A. A. M. Holtslag of KNMI), resulting in significantly improved
estimates of boundary layer height, and a substantial reduction in the
overall magnitude of the hydrological cycle. Parameterized convection
was also modified where this process was represented using the deep
moist convection formalism of in conjunction with the scheme developed
by for CCM2. This change resulted in an additional reduction in the
magnitude of the hydrological cycle and a smoother distribution of
tropical precipitation. Surface roughness over oceans was also diagnosed
as a function of surface wind speed and stability, resulting in more
realistic surface flux estimates for low wind speed conditions. The
combination of these changes to hydrological components resulted in a
13% reduction in the annually averaged global latent heat flux and the
associated precipitation rate. It should be pointed out that the
improvements in the radiative and hydrological cycle characteristics of
the model climate were achieved without compromising the quality of the
simulated equilibrium thermodynamic structures (one of the major
strengths of the CCM2) thanks in part to the incorporation of a style
evaporation of stratiform precipitation.

The CCM3 incorporated version 1 of the Land Surface Model (LSM)
developed by which provided for the comprehensive treatment of land
surface processes. This was a one-dimensional model of energy, momentum,
water, and CO\ :math:`_2` exchange between the atmosphere and land,
accounting for ecological differences among vegetation types, hydraulic
and thermal differences among soil types, and allowing for multiple
surface types including lakes and wetlands within a grid cell. LSM
replaced the prescribed surface wetness, prescribed snow cover, and
prescribed surface albedos in CCM2. It also replaced the land surface
fluxes in CCM2, using instead flux parameterizations that included
hydrological and ecological processes (soil water, phenology, stomatal
physiology, interception of water by plants).

The fourth class of changes to the CCM2 included the option to run CCM3
with a simple slab ocean-thermodynamic sea ice model. The model employs
a spatially and temporally prescribed ocean heat flux and mixed layer
depth, which ensures replication of realistic sea surface temperatures
and ice distributions for the present climate. The model allowed for the
simplest interactive surface for the ocean and sea ice components of the
climate system.

The final class of model modifications included a change to the form of
the hydrostatic matrix which ensures consistency between :math:`\omega`
and the discrete continuity equation, and a more generalized form of the
gravity wave drag parameterization. In the latter case, the
parameterization was configured to behave in the same way as the CCM2
parameterization of wave drag, but included the capability to exploit
more sophisticated descriptions of this process.

One of the more significant implementation differences with the earlier
model was that CCM3 included an optional message-passing configuration,
allowing the model to be executed as a parallel task in
distributed-memory environments. This was an example of how the Climate
and Global Dynamics Division continued to invest in technical
improvements to the CCM in the interest of making it easier to acquire
and use in evolving computational environments. As was the case for
CCM2, the code was internally documented, obviating the need for a
separate technical note that describes each subroutine and common block
in the model library. Thus, the Users’ Guide, the land surface technical
note, the CCM3 technical note , the actual code and a series of reviewed
scientific publications (including a special issue of the Journal of
Climate, Volume 11, Number 6) were designed to completely document CCM3.

------
 CAM3
------

The CAM3 was the fifth generation of the NCAR atmospheric GCM. The name
of the model series was changed from Community Climate Model to
Community Atmosphere Model to reflect the role of CAM3 in the fully
coupled climate system. In contrast to previous generations of the
atmospheric model, CAM3 had been designed through a collaborative
process with users and developers in the Atmospheric Model Working Group
(AMWG). The AMWG includes scientists from NCAR, the university
community, and government laboratories. For CAM3, the consensus of the
AMWG was to retain the spectral Eulerian dynamical core for the first
official release although the code includes the option to run with
semi-Lagrange dynamics or with finite-volume dynamics (FV). The addition
of FV was a major extension to the model provided through a
collaboration between NCAR and NASA Goddard’s Data Assimilation Office
(DAO). The major changes in the physics included treatment of cloud
condensed water using a prognostic formulation with a bulk microphysical
component following and a macroscale component following . The
parameterization for deep convection was retained from CCM3.

A new treatment of geometrical cloud overlap in the radiation
calculations computed the shortwave and longwave fluxes and heating
rates for random overlap, maximum overlap, or an arbitrary combination
of maximum and random overlap. The calculation was completely separated
from the radiative parameterizations. The introduction of the
generalized overlap assumptions permitted more realistic treatments of
cloud-radiative interactions. The methodology was designed and validated
against calculations based upon the independent column approximation
(ICA). A new parameterization for the longwave absorptivity and
emissivity of water vapor preserved the formulation of the radiative
transfer equations using the absorptivity/emissivity method. The
components of the method related to water vapor were replaced with new
terms calculated with the General Line-by-line Atmospheric Transmittance
and Radiance Model (GENLN3). The mean absolute errors in the surface and
top-of-atmosphere clear-sky longwave fluxes for standard atmospheres
were reduced to less than 1 W/m\ :math:`{}^2`. The near-infrared
absorption by water vapor was also updated to a parameterization based
upon the HITRAN2k line database that incorporated the CKD 2.4
prescription for the continuum. The magnitude of errors in flux
divergences and heating rates relative to modern LBL calculations were
reduced by approximately seven times compared to the previous CCM3
parameterization. The uniform background aerosol was replaced with a
present-day climatology of sulfate, sea-salt, carbonaceous, and
soil-dust aerosols. The climatology was obtained from a chemical
transport model forced with meteorological analysis and constrained by
assimilation of satellite aerosol retrievals. These aerosols affect the
shortwave energy budget of the atmosphere. CAM3 also included a
mechanism for treating the shortwave and longwave effects of volcanic
aerosols. Evaporation of convective precipitation following was
implemented and enhancement of atmospheric moisture through this
mechanism was offset by drying introduced by changes in the longwave
absorptivity and emissivity. A careful formulation of vertical diffusion
of dry static energy was also implemented.

Additional capabilities included a new thermodynamic package for sea ice
in order to mimic the major non-dynamical aspects of CSIM; including
snow depth, brine pockets, internal shortwave radiative transfer,
surface albedo, ice-atmosphere drag, and surface exchange fluxes. CAM3
also allowed for an explicit representation of fractional land and
sea-ice coverage that gave a much more accurate representation of flux
exchanges from coastal boundaries, island regions, and ice edges. This
fractional specification provided a mechanism to account for flux
differences due to sub-grid inhomogeneity of surface types. A new,
extensible climatological and time-mean sea-surface temperature boundary
data was made available from a blended product using the global HadISST
OI dataset prior to 1981 and the Smith/Reynolds EOF dataset post-1981.
Coupling was upgraded in order to couple the dynamical core with the
parameterization suite in a purely time split or process split manner.
The distinction is that in the process split approximation the physics
and dynamics are both calculated from the same past state, while in the
time split approximations the dynamics and physics are calculated
sequentially, each based on the state produced by the other.

CAM4
~~~~

The CAM4 was the sixth generation of the NCAR atmospheric GCM and had
again been developed through a collaborative process of users and
developers in the Atmosphere Model Working Group (AMWG) with signficant
input from the Chemistry Climate Working Group (Chem-Clim WG) and the
Whole Atmosphere Model Working Group (WAMWG). The model had science
enhancements from CAM3 and represented an intermediate release version
as part of a staged and parallel process in atmospheric model
development. In the CAM4 changes to the moist physical representations
centered on enhancements to the existing deep convection
parameterization. The calculation of Convective Available Potential
Energy (CAPE) assumed an entraining plume to provide the in-cloud
temperature and humidity profiles used to determine bouyancy and related
cloud closure properties (chapter [ssec:deep-convection]). The
modification is based on the conservation of moist entropy and mixing
methods of . It replaced the standard undilute non-entraining plume
method used in CAM3 and was employed to increase convection sensitivity
to tropospheric moisture and reduce the amplitude of the diurnal cycle
of precipitation over land. Sub-grid scale Convective Momentum
Transports (CMT) were added to the deep convection scheme following and
the methodology of (chapter [ssec:Convection-CMT]). CMT affects
tropospheric climate mainly through changes to the Coriolis torque.
These changes resulted in improvement of the Hadley circulation during
northern Winter and it reduced many of the model biases. In an annual
mean, the tropical easterly bias, subtropical westerly bias, and the
excessive southern hemisphere mid-latitude jet were improved.

In combination these modifications to the deep-convection lead to
significant improvements in the phase, amplitude and spacial anomaly
patterns of the modeled El Niño, as documented in . The calculation of
cloud fraction in polar climates was also modified for the CAM4.0. Due
to the combination of a diagnostic cloud fraction and prognostic cloud
water represntation it was possible to model unphysical extensive cloud
decks with near zero in-cloud water in the CAM3. This was particularly
pervasize in polar climates in Winter. These calculation inconsitencies
and large cloud fractions are significantly reduced with modifications
to the calculation of stratiform cloud following . In the lower
troposphere a ’freeze-drying’ process is perfomed whereby cloud
fractions were systematically reduced for very low water vaopr amounts.
The low cloud reduction caused an Arctic-wide drop of 15 W
m\ :math:`^{-2}` in surface cloud radiative forcing (CRF) during winter
and about a 50% decrease in mean annual Arctic CRF. Consequently,
wintertime surface temperatures fell by up to 4 K on land and 2 K over
the Arctic Ocean, thus significantly reducing the CAM3 pronounced warm
bias. More generally the radiation calculation was performed using
inconsistent cloud fraction and condensate quantities in the CAM3. In
CAM4 this was remedied with an updated cloud fraction calculation prior
to the radiation call at each physics timestep. The coupled climate
performance with the CAM4.0 physics changes was summarized in the
horizontal resolution comparison study of .

For the dynamical core component of CAM4 the finite volume (FV) scheme
was made the default due to its superior transport properties .
Modifications were made that upgraded the code version to a more recent
NASA Goddard supported version. Other changes provided new horizontal
grid discretizations (e.g., 1.9x2.5 deg and 0.9x1.25 deg) for optimal
computational processor decompostion and polar filtering changes for
noise reductions and more continuous (in latitude) filtering. In
addition to the existing finite volume and spectral-based dynamical core
a new option was also made available that represents the first scheme
released with CAM that removes the computational scalability
restrictions associated with a pole convergent latitude-longitude grid
and the associated polar filtering requirements.

Funded in part by the Department of Energy (DOE) Climate Change
Prediction Program the scalable and efficient spectral-element-based
atmospheric dynamical core uses the High Order Method Modeling
Environment (HOMME) on a cubed sphere grid and was developed by members
of the Computational Science Section and the Computational Numerics
Group of NCAR’s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL).
The finite element dynamical core (commonly referred to as the HOMME
core) is fully integrated into CCSM coupling architecture and is
invaluable for high resolution climate integrations on existing and
upcoming massively parallel computing platforms.

Model flexibility was increased significantly from the CAM3, both within
CAM and the CCSM system as a whole. The method for running thermodynamic
sea-ice in CAM-only mode was moved to be maintained entirely within the
CICE model of the CCSM4. The single-column version of CAM was given the
flexibility to be built and run using the same infrastructure as the CAM
build and run mechanism. The SCAM GUI run method was no longer
supported. The increased coupling flexibility also allowed the
introduction of a more consistant method for performing slab-ocean model
(SOM) experiments. SOM experiments were, by default, now performed using
forcing data from an existing CCSM coupled run. This had the advantage
of having a closed temperature budget for both the ice and the ocean
mixed layer from a coupled run. The methodology was therefore configured
to reproduce the fully coupled CCSM climate as opposed to a reproduction
of a psuedo-observed climate available with the CAM3-specific SOM
method. The CAM3-specific SOM method was no longer made available. For
more information regarding updated run methods see the CAM4.0 users
guide of .

 *The Community Atmosphere Model*
----------------------------------

CAM has been modified substantially with a range of enhancements and
improvements in the representation of physical processes since version 4
(CAM4). In particular, the combination of physical parameterization
enhancements makes it possible to simulate full aerosol cloud
interactions including cloud droplet activation by aerosols,
precipitation processes due to particle size dependant behavior and
explicit radiative interaction of cloud particles. As such the
represents the first version of CAM that is able to simulate the
cloud-aerosol indirect radiative effects. More generally forms the main
atmopshere component of the COmmunity Earth System Model, version 1
(CESM1). The entensive list of physical parameterization improvements
are described below:

A new moist turbulence scheme (Section [sec:pbl:sub:`u`\ w]) is included
that explicitly simulates stratus-radiation-turbulence interactions,
making it possible to simulate full aerosol indirect effects within
stratus. It is based on a diagnostic Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE)
forumlation and uses a :math:`1^{st}` order K-diffusion scheme with
entrainment originally developed at the University of Washington.. The
scheme operates in any layer of the atmopshere when the moist :math:`Ri`
( Richardson number ) is larger than its critical value.

A new shallow convection scheme (Section [sec:shallow-convection]) uses
a realistic plume dilution equation and closure that accurately
simulates the spatial distribution of shallow convective activity . A
steady state convective updraft plume and small fractional area are
assumed. An explicit computation of the convective updraft vertcial
velocity and updraft fraction is performed using an updraft vertical
momentum equation, and thus provides a representation of convective
momentum transports. The scheme is specifically designed to interact
with the new moist turbulence scheme in order to prevent double counting
seen in previous CAM parameterizations. The deep convection
parameterization is retained from CAM4.0 (Section
[ssec:deep-convection]).

Stratiform microphysical processes (Section [sec:microphysics]) are
represented by a prognostic, two-moment formulation for cloud droplet
and cloud ice with mass and number concentrations following the original
parameterization of . The implimentation in determines liquid and ice
particle sizes from gamma functions and their evolution in time is
subject to grid-scale advection, convective detrainment, turbulent
diffusion and several microphysical processes. Activation of cloud
droplets occurs on an aerosol size distribution based on aerosol
chemistry, temperature and vertical velocity. A sub-grid scale vertical
velocity is provided through a turbulent kinetic energy approximation. A
number of mechanisms are calcuated for ice crystal nucleation and
combined with modifications to allow ice supersaturation .

The revised cloud macrophysics scheme (Section [sec:macrophysics],)
provides a more transparent treatment of cloud processes and imposes
full consistency between cloud fraction and cloud condensate. Separate
calculations are performed for liquid and ice stratiform cloud fractions
which are assumed to be maximally overlapped. Liquid cloud fraction is
based on an assumed triangular distribution of total relative humidity.
Ice cloud fraction is based on and allows supersaturation via a modified
relative humidity over ice and the inclusion of ice condensate amount.

A new 3-mode modal aerosol scheme (MAM3, Section [sec:aerosols], )
provides internally mixed representations of number concentrations and
mass for Aitkin, accumulation and course aerosol modes which are merged
characterizations of the more complex 7-mode version of the scheme.
Anthropogenic emissions, defined as originating from industrial,
domestic and agriculture activity sectors, are provided from the IPCC
AR5 emission data set. Emissions of black carbon and organic carbon
represent an update of and . Emissions of sulfur dioxide are an update
of . Injection heights, and size distribution of emissions data are not
provided with the raw datasets so the protocols of are followed for .
AEROCOM emission datastes are used for natural aeroso0l sources. All
emission datasets required to run MAM for pre-industrial or 20th century
scenarios are available for download. A full inventory of
observationally based aerosol emission mass and size is provided in
standard available datasets. The 7-mode version of the scheme is also
available.

Calculations and specifications for the condensed phase optics
(aerosols, liquid cloud droplets, hydrometeors and ice crystals) are
taken from the microphysics and aerosol parmeterization quantities and
provided as input to the radiation scheme (Section
[sec:condensed:sub:`o`\ ptics]). The radiation scheme (Section
[sec:radiation]) has been updated to the Rapid Radiative Transfer Method
for GCMs (RRTMG, ). It employs an efficient and accurate modified
correlated-k method for calculating radiative fluxes and heating rates
in the clear sky and for the condensed phase species. For each
short-wave band calculation extinction optical depth, single scattering
albedo and asymmetry properties are specified. For each long-wave band
mass-specific absorption is specified. The aerosol optical properties
are defined for each mode of the MAM as described by . Hygroscopicity
characteristics are specified for soluable species. For volcanic
aerosols a geometric mean radius is used. Optical properties of aerosols
are combined prior to the radiative calculation. Liquid-cloud optics are
calculated following and ice-cloud optics are calculated following .
Ice-cloud size optics are extended to allow for radiatively active
falling snow. Optical properties of clouds (including separate fractions
and in-cloud water contents) are combined prior to the radiative
calculation. RRTM separates the short-wave spectrum into 14 bands
extending from 0.2 :math:`\mu`\ m to 12.2 :math:`\mu`\ m, and models
sources of extinction for H\ :math:`_2`\ O, O\ :math:`_3`,
CO\ :math:`_2`, O\ :math:`_2`, CH\ :math:`_4`, N\ :math:`_2` and
Rayleigh scattering. Solar irradiance is now specified for the
short-wave bands from the Lean dataset . The long-wave spectrum is
separated into 16 bands extending from 3.1 :math:`\mu`\ m to 1000
:math:`\mu`\ m with molecular sources of absorption for the same
species, in addition to CFC-11 (containing multiple CFC species) and
CFC-12. RRTMG has extensive modifications from the original RRTM in
order to provide significant speed-up for long climate integrations.
Chief amongt these is the Monte-Carlo Independent Column Approximation
(McICA, ) that represnts sub-grid scale cloud variability. With these
modifications RRTMG still retains superior offline agreement with
line-by-line calculations when compared to the previous CAM radiation
package (CAM-RT).

--------------------------------------
 *The CAM Chemistry Model (CAM-CHEM)*
--------------------------------------

Chemistry in CAM is now fully interactive and implemented in CESM
(Section [sec:chem:sub:`c`\ am]); in particular, emissions of biogenic
compounds and deposition of aerosols to snow, ice, ocean and vegetation
are handled through the coupler. The released version of CAM-chem in
CESM is using the recently-developed superfast chemistry (Section
[sec:chem:sub:`s`\ uperfast]), in collaboration with P. Cameron-Smith
from LLNL and M. Prather from UCI) to perform centennial scale
simulations at a minor cost increase over the base CAM4. These
simulations use the recently developed 1850-2005 emissions created in
support of CMIP5.

--------------------------------------------------------
 *The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM)*
--------------------------------------------------------

WACCM4 (Section [sec:waccm]), incorporates several improvements and
enhancements over the previous version (3.1.9). It can be run coupled to
the POP2 and CICE CESM model components. The model’s chemistry module
(Section [sec:chem:sub:`c`\ am]) has been updated according to the
latest JPL-2006 recommendations; a quasi-biennial oscillation may be
imposed (as an option) by relaxing the winds to observations in the
Tropics; heating from stratospheric volcanic aerosols is now computed
explicitly; the effects of solar proton events are now included; the
effect of unresolved orography is parameterized as a surface stress
(turbulent mountain stress) leading to an improvement in the frequency
of sudden stratospheric warmings; and gravity waves due to convective
and frontal sources are parameterized based upon the occurrence of
convection and the diagnosis of regions of frontogenesis in the model.
