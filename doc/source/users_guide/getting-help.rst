Resources and Getting Help
**************************

This chapter describes several ways in which a user may obtain help when using CAM.

-----------------------
The CESM Tutorial
-----------------------

CAM is run in various configurations of the CESM.  The `CESM tutorial
<https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials>`__ is held annually and
provides extensive resources for running the model.  Links to the agenda
and presentations from the most recent tutorial will be found `here
<https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials/cesm>`__.  The top level entry
to the tutorial resources is `here
<https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/README.html>`__.

------------------------------
The CESM Bulletin Board
------------------------------

The `CESM Bulletin Board <http://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm>`__ is a moderated
forum for rapid exchange of information, ideas, and topics of interest
relating to all components of the CESM.  This includes sharing software
tools, datasets, programming tips and examples, as well as discussions of
questions, problems and workarounds.  The primary motivation for the
establishment of this forum is to facilitate and encourage communication
between the users of the CESM around the world. This bulletin board will
also be used to distribute announcements related to CESM.

You will find specific sections about CAM, WACCM and CAM-chem.

---------------------
Reporting bugs
---------------------

If a user should encounter bugs in the code (i.e., it doesn't behave the
way in which the documentation says it should), the problem should be
reported electronically to the `CESM Bulletin Board
<http://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm>`__.  When writing a bug report the guiding
principle should be to provide enough information so that the bug can be
reproduced.  The following list suggests the minimal information that
should be contained in the report:

#. The version number of the CESM release that CAM is part of (or the CAM
   tag if it was a standalone checkout).

#. The architecture on which the code was built. Include relevant
   information such as the Fortran compiler, MPI library, etc.

#. The ``create_newcase`` command-line. If it is this command that is
   failing, then report the output from this command.

#. Any ``xmlchange`` commands.

#. Any namelist modifications in ``user_nl_cam``.

#. Model printout. Ideally this would contain a stack trace (See
   :ref:`Running in DEBUG mode <ug70-debug-mode>`). But it should at least
   contain any error messages printed to the output log.

.. important::

  CAM is a research tool; not all features contained in the code base
  are supported.
